            <h5>CONCEPT</h5>
            <p class="mt">The dimension of time is crucial to our understanding of patterns and understanding of context. It is an aspect of sound which might be considered an intrinsic, objective physical property from which we cannot escape: for example the attribution of meaning to sound is intrinsically bound by time. But if we could escape from the confines of time, what would that mean for our understanding of the world? Could we tease out hidden information or extract new meaning from sounds when experienced ‘out-of-time’?</p>

            <h5>SPATIAL SOUND INSTITUTE</h5>
            <p class="mt">From August to October 2018, I was able to explore these questions as an artist in residence at the Spatial Sound Institute (SSI). The SSI is a research and development centre for spatial sound, exploring new possibilities in experiencing sound under the theme <a href="https://spatialsoundinstitute.com/programme-1"><i>Ecology of Listening</i></a>. Housed with a 4DSOUND system consisting of 36 omnidirectional speakers and 6 subwoofers spanning 3 floors, sound can be spatialized anywhere around the room with the control of a software interface.</p>
            <p class="mt">A soundscape of recognizable sounds provides an anchor from which participants can navigate. ‘Time’ will then be made subject to the will of the participant who can slow down, speed up, stop, or move backwards within the temporal domain. Familiar sounds will transform into foreign, unknown entities in the space. As multiple people navigate the soundscape, their movements create a dynamic, sonic collage, spontaneously composed from different temporal perspectives. Participants will be challenged to develop their own system of listening, and to interpret the existence of sounds by the collective movement of all individuals in the space.</p>

            <h5>INSTALLATION</h5>
            <p class="mt">
                Position tracking devices are shared among audience members as they explore the space; those with the device have the power to control the soundscape as they freely move through the installation. Sound exists as an omnipresent entity, as sonic potential, in the room wherein the temporal domain is mapped to the spatial domain. While enveloped in their own personal sound space, the participant is bestowed the power to control the soundscape. With each changing position, their presence reveals sonic energy representing a small slice of time; they become an observer with the ability to manifest reality from his or her own perspective and examine sounds outside the constraints of time.
            </p>
            <p class="mt">
                As observers move and interact with one another, a narrative emerges from multiple temporal perspectives that intertwine sonically and spatially to form an ever evolving soundscape. Sound emanates from the observers who cannot escape from the subjective sound bubble in which they are immersed. The observer’s subjective perspective becomes an objective reality to those around them; those without control are able to experience a spatial landscape magically unfolding around them. Throughout the installation each participant has the opportunity to shift between these two roles.
