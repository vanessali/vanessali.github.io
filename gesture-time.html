                As we begin to rely more on the virtual realm, complete worlds are
                played out online as extensions of our minds. Imagination is used to fill
                gaps where physical cues are no longer present. Our sense
                of connection to the body slowly fades to the background as all manners of
                business and communication are conducted online. A Gesture In Time is
                part of ongoing research to study embodied movement and immersion
                to strengthen and reassert the connection between mind and body. In
                virtual collaboration with dancer Paul Lee, we examine ways in which sound
                can be linked to physical gestures to develop meaning, expression
                empathy and communication

                This collaboration with Paul Lee stemmed from our mutual interest to understand and assist in the development of
                self-awareness by slowing down and tuning into the body. There is a universe of potential to expand our perceptual capacity to
                move with flexibility and ease in our ever evolving environment. The way in which we perceive and act in the world is
                shaped by habits and the way we carry ourselves in our everyday lives.

                Dancers traditionally communicate using the interplay of sound and gesture by shaping physical movement to
                predetermined music. Musicians on the other hand use a set of highly skilled physical gestures to play music on an
                instrument. For both, there is a pre-existing framework and a language developed around the art form. These studies
                empower the dancer to also become the musician and be the creator of their sonic environment, to build a feedback loop
                in which sound informs action and action informs sound.
            </p>
            <p class="mt">
                These studies take, a series of precomposed music as the framework or language within which the actor is equipped to
                manifest sound through conscious direction of energy into action. The system of interaction invites the participant to be
                curious through kinesthetic exploration to first learn the rules. Their conception and interpretation of the rules can then be
                adapted to communicate something more meaningful and to allow for a system of movements akin to language to
                organically arise,
